### Manual QA Test Scripts

This excel file contains a number of test scripts that have been written and manually tested. Each test script features the functionality they are testing, what the user's action should be, the expected result of the test script and any pre-test requirements needed to perform a set of test scripts. In addition, each test script also features a Pass/Fail column and the actual results of a test (in case it does not match the expected result).

### Sprint retrospective

This excel file contains notes from our sprint retrospectives. It features what went well in each sprint, and what could be improved in each sprint. In addition, it also features actions needed to be taken in future sprints to ensure that the retrospective issues have been resolved.

### Test Plan

This pdf contains our test plan for the project. It features our project scope, quality objectives, test approach, roles and responsibilityies, our test strategy, and recourses and environment needs and our test schedule.

### UI Design Document

### Set up and running automated test scripts ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDmNUV8OKq8))

This video features setting up the server and client by navigating into their corresponding directories and installing all required dependencies; following this the automated test scripts are ran for both the server and the client. Next, the video shows how you would run both the server and client, in addition to showing the actual react program working in real time. Finally, the video showcases the scalability of the program by resizing the window to different widths and lengths.

### Github actions running test scripts on pull request ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSd44znqm6E))

This video showcases that on a pull request our GitHub actions automatically runs all of the automated test scripts using multiple different dependency versions. First, a pull request is created, then you can see the automated actions starting. Next you can see that once all of the tests have been succesfull, a green check mark appears and the 'Merge pull request' button becomes green, and finally, at the end of the video one of the actions is expanded to show the commands it goes through in order to run each test.
