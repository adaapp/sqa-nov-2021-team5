## Roman numberal converter test scripts

This excel file contains a number of test scripts that have been written and manually tested. Each test script features the functionality they are testing, what the user's action should be, the expected result of the test script and any pre-test requirements needed to perform a set of test scripts. In addition, each test script also features a Pass/Fail column and the actual results of a test (in case it does not match the expected result).
